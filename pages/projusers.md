[Coffea](https://github.com/CoffeaTeam) - a prototype [Analysis
System](http://iris-hep.org/as.html) incorporating Scikit-HEP packages
to provide a lightweight, scalable, portable, and user-friendly
interface for columnar analysis of HEP data. Some of the sub-packages of
Coffea may become Scikit-HEP packages as development continues.

The [zfit](https://zfit.github.io/zfit/) project - it provides a model
fitting library based on TensorFlow and optimised for simple and direct
manipulation of probability density functions.
